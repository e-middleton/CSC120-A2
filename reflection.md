What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

What worked best for me, was testing the code bit by bit to make sure it wasn't going to create a snarly mess, and if it was going to create a snarly mess, I'd have a better idea of where it went wrong. 
What REALLY helps is going to sleep and trying again in the morning. 
I was having a ton of trouble figuring out where to put my itemID, in the class or outside of it, and in which class,
so I phoned a friend and had them point me in the right direction which was super helpful. 

If you don't understand something, try looking for youtube tutorials on the thing you're doing. Like a course on classes in python.

Honestly this assignment threw me for a bit of a loop because all our practices were tiny little single class things that didn't need to interact with other classes, so this took me a really long time to figure out.
